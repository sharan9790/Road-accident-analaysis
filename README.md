🎯 Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze user behavior on the Road Accident using Exploratory Data Analysis.
The challenge is to uncover insights into user preferences, viewing patterns, and trends by analyzing a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle.
Casualites by vehicle type.
Casualites by Road type.
Casualites by Urban/Rural areas.
Create slicers to assess case severity in different Road surface and Weather conditions.
Casualites by location.
This analysis will provide valuable information for content creators, marketers, and platform optimization.

🤔 Challenges Faced
Data Variety: Handling diverse data types, including numerical, date-based, and categorical, posed data preprocessing challenges.

Data Volume: Analyzing a large dataset required efficient memory management and processing techniques.

Data Quality: Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies was critical for accurate analysis.


🌟 Tech Stack
Power Query: Used for Data Cleaning, Processing, and Modeling.
Power Bi: Used for Data analysis and Dashboard Making.

💡 Insights Derived
Road Type Distribution: A bar chart show the distribution of casualties based on road type . This can highlight whether accidents are more prevalent on certain types of roads.

Urban vs. Rural Comparison: A Pie chart compare casualties in urban and rural areas over time or by demographic factors. This can highlight whether accidents are more common in one type of area.

Accident Heatmap: A heatmap overlaid on a map can show the concentration of accidents in specific geographic areas. This can help identify accident hotspots, which are areas with a high number of casualties.


🔮 Future Scope
AI and Machine Learning: Utilizing AI and ML algorithms for real-time accident detection and response.

Predictive Analytics: Developing predictive models for accident prevention and early warning systems.

Blockchain Integration: Using blockchain for secure and transparent accident data sharing among stakeholders.

Traffic Simulation: Using simulation models to test and validate safety measures before implementation.
